# HwWobbe.github.io readme

* This repo can hold a TW5 file?  It's name suggests so, based on what I've seen of other instances.
* the file (type) may be a requirement
* I seem to be able to edit this on my desktop, now.  (2018.12.25)
* Confirm that this is happening reliably (since there seem to be two versions)
* Most recent confirmation edit os f92b593a75bbbc7c71a6ef25f5d4e2eed560d496

# HwWobbe.github.io ( TasksH )

This page will become my core/common Introduction.

<h2> About me ...</h2>

I use TiddlyWiki (for Content)... a LOT!  I also use other Tools (that show what I do, how I do it and, hence, who I am).

* review the most recent documentation findings
* try this with 5.1.18, now that it has been released.
* consider the use of MaarfaPad, if it can be accessed via its URL.
* pursue this with Bob, but not until after MultiUser developments are complete
* consider making this a nodeJs *tid based instance, especially if an external *.tid store evolves
* try uploading a TW5 file to repo ( as a first step )
* try forking an existing TW
