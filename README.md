# HwWobbe.github.io readme
* This repo can hold a TW5 file?  It's name suggests so, based on what I've seen of other instances.
* the file (type) may be a requirement
* this repo was not apparent
<<<<<<< HEAD
* I seem to be able to edit this on my desktop, now.  (2018.12.25)
* Confirm that this is happening reliably (since there seem to be two versions)

* Most recent confirmation edit

<hr>

* review the most recent documentation findings
* try this with 5.1.18, now that it has been released.
* consider the use of MaarfaPad, if it can be accessed via its URL.
* pursue this with Bob, but not until after MultiUser developments are complete
* consider making this a nodeJs *tid based instance, especially if an external *.tid store evolves
* try uploading a TW5 file to repo ( as a first step )
* try forking an existing TW

* consider hosting options ...
* TiddlySpot ( may be easiest )
* Azure hosting, with just a link from here, especially if it can run a nodeJs instance
* this could have developer access that someone like Arlen could setup

* Private repos are apparently only available to Premium ($7/month) users
