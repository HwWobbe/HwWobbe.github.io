* Can this repo hold a TW5 file?  It's name suggests so, based on what I've seen of other instances.
* try uploading a TW5 file to repo ( as a first step )

* consider hosting options ...
* TiddlySpot ( may be easiest )
* Azure hosting, with just a link from here, especially if it can run a nodeJs instance
* this could have developer access that someone like Arlen could setup

* Private repos are apparently only available to Premium ($7/month) users
