This page is becoming my core/common Introduction.

<h2> About me ...</h2>

I use TiddlyWiki (for Content)... a LOT!  I also use other Tools (that show what I do, how I do it and, hence, who I am).

* review the most recent documentation findings
* try this with 5.1.18, now that it has been released.
* consider the use of MaarfaPad, if it can be accessed via its URL.
* pursue this with Bob, but not until after MultiUser developments are complete
* consider making this a nodeJs *tid based instance, especially if an external *.tid store evolves
* try uploading a TW5 file to repo ( as a first step )
* try forking an existing TW

Transitions during a 40+ year career ...

* ... "I would rather give my best Business ideas to my fiercest competitor that have them starve from neglect." :HwWvW
* Clearly just a weekend hacker now.
