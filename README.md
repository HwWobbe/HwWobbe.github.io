# HwWobbe.github.io ( TasksH )
* This repo can hold a TW5 file?  It's name suggests so, based on what I've seen of other instances.
* the file (type) may be a requirement
* this repo was not apparent
* Most recent confirmation edit, reviewed 2018.12.26 to prove that at least a "Commit directly" works reliably for me.
* Apperently there is a delay in seeing the effect of an update Commit.
* Review AccessMethods and the documentation findings contained in TwH.

<hr>

* try this with 5.1.18, now that it has been released.
* consider the use of MaarfaPad, if it can be accessed via its URL.
* pursue this with Bob, but not until after MultiUser developments are complete
* consider making this a nodeJs *tid based instance, especially if an external *.tid store evolves
* try uploading a TW5 file to repo ( as a first step )
* try forking an existing TW

* consider hosting options ...
* TiddlySpot ( may be easiest )
* Azure hosting, with just a link from here, especially if it can run a nodeJs instance
* this could have developer access that someone like Arlen could setup

* Private repos are apparently only available to Premium ($7/month) users
