This page is evolving to become a core Introduction.

<h2> About me ...</h2>

I use TiddlyWiki (for Content)... a LOT!  I also use other Tools (that show what I do, how I do it and, hence, who I am).

Transitions during a 40+ year career ...

* Programmer >
* Technical Sales & Sales Management > 
* Consulting > 
* Banking technologist ( Senior Management ) > 
* Executive (IPO experience) > 
* Special Projects Change Agent >
* Founder & CEO >
* ... > Working towards retirement.
* ... > ... Clearly just a weekend hacker now.

<h2> Considerations ... </h2>
  
* make this a nodeJs *tid based instance, especially as my external *.tid store evolves
* try uploading a TW5 file to repo ( as a first step )
* try forking an existing TW

* consider hosting options ...
* TiddlySpot ( may be easiest )
* Azure hosting, with just a link from here, especially if it can run a nodeJs instance
* this could have developer access that someone like Arlen could setup

* Private repos are apparently only available to Premium ($7/month) users
